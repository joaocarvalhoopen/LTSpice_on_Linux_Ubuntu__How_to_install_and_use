# LTspice on Linux Ubuntu - How to install and use
Make great analog designs

## Description
This are the steps to install and use LTspice 64 bits on Linux Ubuntu 20.04 . <br>

## Installation

```
# Update your package manager.
sudo apt-get update

# Install Wine
sudo apt-get install wine-stable

# Download LTSpice 64 bits
cd /tmp/
wget https://ltspice.analog.com/software/LTspice64.exe

# Install LTSpice
wine LTspice64.exe
rm LTspice64.exe
```

## How to execute LTspice 

```
# if LTspice is installed for current user only:
wine ~/.wine/drive_c/users/<username>/AppData/Local/Programs/ADI/LTspice/LTspice.exe
```

```
# if it's installed system-wide:
wine ~/.wine/drive_c/Program\ Files/LTC/LTspiceXVII/XVIIx64.exe
```

## Create a directory for your simulation files

```
# To open file in LTspice, move it to somewhere in ~/.wine/drive_c folder which is the C drive in wine.
mkdir ~/.wine/drive_c/Program\ Files/LTC/LTspiceXVII/examples/Educational/my_ltspice_files

# Copy file from Examples to my_ltspice_files diretory this is more pratical.
cp ~/.wine/drive_c/Program\ Files/LTC/LTspiceXVII/examples/Educational/Clapp.asc ~/.wine/drive_c/Program\ Files/LTC/LTspiceXVII/examples/Educational/my_ltspice_files/Clapp.asc 

# In this way it is better organized but the examples are far away from your projects directory.
mkdir ~/.wine/drive_c/my_ltspice_files_2
cp ~/my_files/test.asc ~/.wine/drive_c/my_ltspice_files_2/
```

## LTspice Help Manual

The help file ```LTspiceHelp.chm``` will not open correctly inside LTspice. But LTspice, comes also with the documentation in the PDF format. The file is ```LTspiceHelp.pdf``` , just open it.

To open the file ```LTspiceHelp.pdf``` just do:

1. Open the file explorer on Linux ```/home/<user>/``` .

2. Do **Ctrl + H** to see the hidden files and directories that start with a "." (dot) .

3. Navegate to ```~/.wine/drive_c/Program Files/LTC/LTspiceXVII/```

4. Double click on the file ```LTspiceHelp.pdf``` .

5. Do **Ctrl + H** to change again to not see the hidden files and directories that start with a "." (dot) .
